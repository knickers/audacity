# Audacity
[This bash script](https://github.com/knickers/audacity/blob/master/run.sh) will run the Audacity audio editor in a Docker container.

If you're using pulseaudio for sound, you need to also configure ALSA to work properly.

Dynamically enable/disable pulseaudio: https://wiki.debian.org/PulseAudio/#Dynamically_enable.2Fdisable
